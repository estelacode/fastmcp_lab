    "\n",
    "\"When running `asyncio.run()` in a Jupyter notebook, a RuntimeError occurs because the notebook already has an event loop running. To fix this, use `nest_asyncio` or run the code in a `standalone Python script` instead.\"\n",
    " \n",
    "* The `asyncio` library is an standard of Python for async programming. It is used to write asynchronous code that runs concurrently, namely, that can realize several tasks at the same time without blocking the running of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `nest_asyncio` library is used to run asynchronous  code within an existing event loop. It is useful when it want to execute asynchronous code within an enviroment that it has an event loop in execution, as in the case with Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency** is the ability to handle multiple tasks at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously. It means that tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, often with a single processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Example`: Imagine a single chef (CPU) preparing multiple dishes (tasks) at once. They might chop vegetables for one dish, then stir another, then start a third, and so on. The dishes aren't all being cooked at the exact same moment, but the chef is managing them all concurrently. In programming, this is achieved through context switching, where the CPU rapidly switches between different tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallelism** is the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, often on different processor cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Example`: Now imagine two chefs (two CPUs) each working on a different dish simultaneously. They are both cooking at the same time, using their own resources (stoves, pots). This is parallelism – tasks executing truly at the same time. In programming, this requires multiple processing units (cores) to run tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Asynchronous programming** is a technique that allows tasks to run without blocking the main program flow. In other words, allows a program to perform multiple operations concurrently without waiting for each operation to complete before starting the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Example`: Think of a person ordering food at a restaurant. They place the order (initiate a task) and then can continue browsing their phone or talking to a friend (do other work) while the restaurant prepares the food. The person doesn't have to sit and stare at the kitchen waiting for the food. In programming, asynchronous operations allow a program to continue executing other code while waiting for a task (like fetching data from a database or a website) to complete. This prevents the program from becoming unresponsive. "
